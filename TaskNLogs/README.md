GPT Prompot: Give me a Task and log automation that I can do on my Arch Linux. I was thinking about something, backing up some directories in my ~/.config/ on my GitHub, I make a lot of changes often, and it's important to keep then up-to-date case something happen to my system, organizing my Downloads folder like deleting old files 3-7 days old, organizing videos, photos, compressed, and documents, cleaning trash, also daily do check in my system, for example, benchmark of powering up, open applications, check packages that I should update for keep everything as most optimized possible, I'm not often restart my PC, so maybe also something that alert me that I'm more than 3 days without restarting my computer. And it will happen soon, what do you think? I'm thinking of this as a project to learn to automate tasks and generate logs, with bash, maybe,P ytho, and Go, of course bash would be the most recommended and easy for this

# Project: **Arch Linux Automation and Log System** (`autolog`)

## 1. **Back up important configs to GitHub**
- Backup selected folders from `~/.config/` (e.g., Hyprland, Kitty, Waybar configs).
- Git commit & push **only if changes are detected**.
- Run **daily** via a cron job or systemd timer.
- Generate a **log file** like `/var/log/autolog/backup.log`.

ðŸ›  Tools: `bash`, `git`, maybe `inotifywait` later for real-time backup.

---

## 2. **Organize Downloads folder**
- Files older than **7 days** âž” automatically **deleted** or **archived** (moved to `~/Downloads/Old`).
- **Sort** files into:
  - `~/Downloads/Videos/`
  - `~/Downloads/Documents/`
  - `~/Downloads/Compressed/`
  - `~/Downloads/Images/`
- Generate a **log** of what was moved or deleted.

ðŸ›  Tools: `bash`, `find`, `mv`, `rm`.

---

## 3. **System Clean-up**
- Clean `/home/*/.local/share/Trash/*`.
- Clean package cache (`sudo pacman -Sc`).
- Check for orphaned packages (`pacman -Qdtq`).
- Optionally clean old log files.

ðŸ›  Tools: `bash`, `pacman`.

---

## 4. **Daily System Health Check**
- Benchmark:
  - Boot time (`systemd-analyze`).
  - Startup services time (`systemd-analyze blame`).
- Check:
  - Updates available (`checkupdates` from `pacman-contrib` package).
  - Disk usage (`df -h`, `du -sh ~/.config`).
  - Memory and swap usage (`free -h`).
- Generate a **health report** in `/var/log/autolog/health.log`.

ðŸ›  Tools: `bash`.

---

## 5. **Uptime Monitoring and Restart Reminder**
- If uptime > 3 days, show a **notification** using `notify-send`.
- Also log an alert (`/var/log/autolog/uptime.log`).

ðŸ›  Tools: `bash`, `uptime`, `notify-send`.

# Folder Structure Example
```bash
~/autolog/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ backup_config.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ organize_downloads.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup_system.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ daily_health.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ uptime_check.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ backup.log
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ organize.log
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup.log
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ health.log
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ uptime.log
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ install.sh  # (to set up timers/cronjobs)
```

# Possible Future Upgrades:
- Migrate from bash to **Python** if you want better parsing, emailing reports, or a web dashboard.
- Use **Go** if you want a super fast daemon/service later.
- Integrate with **systemd timers** instead of cron for more robustness.
- Add a **backup encryption** (like `gpg`) before sending to GitHub.
- Create a **simple GTK or TUI dashboard** to view reports.

---

# Why this is a Great Project:
- You learn bash scripting deeply (variables, conditions, loops, cron/systemd).
- You get real experience in **automation**, **system maintenance**, and **log management**.
- It's **useful** daily â€” not just a "dummy" project.
- Super expandable: Bash âž” Python âž” Go âž” Web âž” Full Personal Assistant.
